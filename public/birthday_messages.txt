Do not count the candles, but see the light they give. Don't count your years but the life you live. Happy Birthday.
Forget the past; it is gone. Do not think of the future; it has not come. But live in the present because it's a gift and that's why it's called the present. Happy birthday.
You are the sweetest person I know, and this birthday is a fresh beginning. I wish you confidence, courage, and capability. Happy birthday.
Your birthday has come around after 365 days. That's a pretty long time. Deal with the pressure because thats how diamonds are made. Happy birthday.
